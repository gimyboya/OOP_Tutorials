# Awesome README

Here you will find all the examples and the solutions of the tutorial classes that we solve in class.

Please take the time to read this README as it contains useful links and trick on how to get the most of your learning experience.

# Why Github?

- To provide a starting point for me or other tutors.

- To keep improving the content and adapting it to the students need.

- To `Push` the Students to `Pull` the content of this ripository and make them a bit familiar with Git and Github.
- [whatch](http://bit.ly/DevtipsGit) this short videos to understand what is Git and Github

# How to use this 

- There is a "Download ZIP" button on the right side of this page. Download the package and extract to a folder of your choice. All the folders containing the solutions will be on your machine 

  ![download](../reveal/img/download.gif)

  **Note:** most of the projects are made in IntelliJ which means you can't open the project on eclips but you can still view the files with `.java ` extension

- Or if you want an automated way to you can [install git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) then run the following commands:

  `git clone https://github.com/gimyboya/OOP_Tutorials.git`  this command will clone this repo on your machine
  after the cloning is done run this commant `cd OOP_Tutorials` to move inside the folder 
  the run this command `git remote add upstream https://github.com/gimyboya/OOP_Tutorials.git` this will connect your folder to this repo remotly via git

  then finally `git pull` will pull all the new content if any which means whenever i update this repo if you run that command you will instantly receive all the changes on your machine via git. 

  ```git
  git clone https://github.com/gimyboya/OOP_Tutorials.git
  cd OOP_Tutorials
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/gimyboya/OOP_Tutorials.git
  git pull
  ```
  above are all the commands to set up your clone for the first time after that all you need to do is just ren the command `git pull`.
