# Binding:

Connecting a method call to the method body is known as binding.

## Static binding:

Known at compile time

bind function call to the most general function body

happens with:

- overloaded functions (because the compiler checks for errors when arguments are passed to a function)
- static
- final 
- private

## Dynamic Binding:

Known at run time 

overridden functions are binded dynamically.
